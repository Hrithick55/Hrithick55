# 👋 Hi, I'm Hrthick

I’m a passionate Full-Stack Developer in the making, focused on building responsive, user-friendly web applications. Currently exploring technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mysql, Python and Django. I love turning ideas into interactive digital experiences.

I’m constantly learning — from designing clean interfaces to writing efficient backend logic. My goal is to grow into a developer who can build complete, scalable products from scratch.

💡 Always open to learning opportunities, collaborations, and feedback that help me become a better developer every day.

I enjoy transforming design concepts into functional web pages, experimenting with layouts, animations, and user interactions that make websites engaging and easy to use.

I’m currently expanding my knowledge by working on small projects and exploring frameworks like React.js to strengthen my development foundation.

💡 Core Skills: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Responsive Design | Python| Mysql | Version Control (Git)

📩 Open to internship or entry-level opportunities where I can contribute, learn from experienced developers, and grow as a web professional.
